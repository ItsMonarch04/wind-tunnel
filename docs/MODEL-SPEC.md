# Wind Tunnel Model Specification

This is the authoritative mathematical contract for the pricing engine. It was
extracted from `CONTEXT.md` in P1; section numbering intentionally remains
stable so tests can cite individual requirements. Money is modeled as floating
dollars, not accounting currency units.

## §4. Economic model contract

### §4.1 Buyer model

For each segment `s`, account count is `n_s`, seat count is `c_s`, full-catalog
median account WTP is `W_s`, and within-segment spread is `σ_s`. A feature
catalog is `F`; an offer `o` has feature set `F_o` and list price `p_o`.
Flat prices are $/account/month; per-seat prices become the effective
account-level price `P_s(o) = p_o · c_s`. Segment feature value is
`V_s(o) = Σ_(f ∈ F_o) v[s,f]`; all values are account-level.

Individual scale is `ε ~ LogNormal(0, σ_s²)` (median 1), so buyer utility is
`u(o) = ε · V_s(o) − P_s(o)` and the outside option has utility 0. The model is
horizontal across segments and vertical within a segment. Input allocation
shares map to values as `v[s,f] = W_s · w[s,f]` with `Σ_f w[s,f] = 1`.

`σ_s` is buyer heterogeneity, while P10/P90 bands around `W_s` and `n_s` are
assumption uncertainty used only by Monte Carlo. All band values are positive,
their base is P50, and `base = sqrt(q10 · q90)`. Given a valid band:

```text
μ = (ln q10 + ln q90) / 2 = ln base
σ = ln(q90 / q10) / (2 · z90)
z90 = 1.2815515655446004
```

`q10 = q90 = base` is the deterministic `σ = 0` branch.

Required tests: T-STAT-01 validates Φ reference values; T-STAT-02 validates
the Φ/Φ⁻¹ round trip; T-STAT-03 round-trips fitted P10/P90 bands; and
T-STAT-04 compares lognormal partial expectation with independent Simpson
integration. T-STAT-02 holds to `1e-9` on the interior grid and to `1e-8` at
the `±6σ` endpoints: binary64 CDF output at `+6σ` cannot retain more tail
detail, and the measured round trip is about `8.85e-9`.

### §4.2 Offer selection — utility upper envelope

Each buyer selects `argmax_o { ε · V_s(o) − P_s(o) }`, including the outside
option. The tie tolerance is `1e-9`. `selectOffers` has two modes:

- `conservative` is the product default: prefer lower effective price, then
  lower value, and prefer the outside option on a paid-vs-outside tie.
- `seller-favorable` is only for σ=0 screening/bundling oracles: prefer higher
  value, then higher price, and participation over the outside option.

When an own and competitor offer have identical effective `(value, price)`,
the competitor owns the share. This is an explicit conservative attribution
policy: it preserves the five-term identity by recording the result as
competitor loss rather than own revenue. Stable offer ID is only a fallback for
otherwise economically identical offers of the same owner class.

An offer is a utility line `u_o(ε) = V_o ε − P_o`. The active menu is its upper
envelope, with increasing values and entry breakpoints:

```text
ε*(o_k → o_(k+1)) = (P_(k+1) − P_k) / (V_(k+1) − V_k)
```

Deduplicate equal-value offers by retaining the lowest price, sort by value,
and stack-scan, popping a line whose intersection is at or before its
predecessor's entry. In a positive-spread segment, the active offer's share on
`(a_k, b_k]` is:

```text
share_k = Φ(ln(b_k) / σ_s) − Φ(ln(a_k) / σ_s)
```

with intervals clipped to `ε > 0`. At `σ_s = 0`, all mass is at `ε = 1` and a
direct argmax uses the selected tie mode.

The offer set comprises every tier plus each subset of up to three add-ons not
already wholly included in that tier, the outside option, and active competitor
alternatives. A composite has the union of its features and summed effective
prices. The cap is five tiers × 2³ add-on subsets + outside + six competitors.

Required tests: T-ENV-01 dominated offers; T-ENV-02 ordered breakpoints and
share conservation; T-ENV-03 independent brute-force cross-validation;
T-ENV-04 σ=0 ties; T-ENV-05 free-tier behavior; T-ADD-01 subset expansion;
and T-CMP-08 deterministic competitor-first own/competitor tie attribution.

### §4.3 Economics readouts and value conservation

For active intervals `(a_k, b_k]`, define
`L(a,b) = E[ε · 1(a < ε ≤ b)]`:

```text
L(a,b) = e^(σ²/2) · [Φ((σ² − ln a)/σ) − Φ((σ² − ln b)/σ)]
```

with zero/infinite limits handled analytically. For a segment, with
`V_full = V_s(F)`, compute:

```text
Revenue         = n_s · Σ_own paid share_k · P_k
OwnBuyerSurplus = n_s · Σ_own [V_k · L(a_k,b_k) − P_k · share_k]
FencingGap      = n_s · Σ_own (V_full − V_k) · L(a_k,b_k)
Unserved        = n_s · V_full · L(outside interval)
CompetitorLoss  = n_s · Σ_competitor V_full · L(a_k,b_k)
Potential       = n_s · e^(σ²/2) · V_full
```

The required identity is
`Potential = Revenue + OwnBuyerSurplus + FencingGap + Unserved + CompetitorLoss`.
Without competitors it is the four-term form. Competitor utility/revenue is
never own buyer surplus. KPIs are MRR, paid conversion, ARPA, capture rate,
and, when active, competitor-loss share. Remove-offer counterfactuals report
MRR deltas. T-ECON-01…06 and T-CMP-07 validate this section.

### §4.4 Price sweeps

Sweep a selected tier's list-price unit over 400 grid points plus its exact
current price. For flat prices start at `max(current, 1.5 × max V_full)`; for
per-seat start at `max(current, 1.5 × max(V_full / c_s))`. Double the upper
bound while revenue rises at the edge or the best point is in the top 5%, up to
eight expansions. A boundary optimum at the cap is explicitly labeled “best in
searched range.” Composite offers derived from the changed tier move with it.
T-SWP-01…04 validate inclusion, monotonic demand, a golden optimum, and the
adaptive-boundary behavior.

### §4.5 Second-degree price-discrimination oracle

For two types `L, H` and Basic ⊂ Pro under single crossing, the serve-both
oracle is `p_B = V_LB` and `p_P = V_HP − V_HB + V_LB`. Exclude L iff
`n_H · (V_HB − V_LB) > n_L · V_LB`, then set `p_P = V_HP`. These fixtures run
at `σ = 0` with `seller-favorable`; exact binding-price ties are intentional.
T-SCRN-01…04 reproduce the closed-form result.

### §4.6 Bundling oracle

For two goods, compare pure components, pure bundle, and mixed bundling by
enumerating the stated candidate price bounds and taking the best valid revenue
under the same envelope/tie convention. T-BND-01…04 validate canonical
textbook cases, regime nesting, and deterministic ties.

### §4.7 Van Westendorp price sensitivity meter

The survey-first PSM takes one respondent quadruple
`(too cheap ≤ cheap ≤ expensive ≤ too expensive)`. Non-finite, negative, or
order-violating quadruples are reported and excluded; they are never repaired
or silently re-ordered. On the union grid of valid response prices, construct:

```text
too cheap      = share(response.tooCheap ≥ price)
cheap          = share(response.cheap ≥ price)
expensive      = share(response.expensive ≤ price)
too expensive  = share(response.tooExpensive ≤ price)
not cheap      = 1 − cheap
not expensive  = 1 − expensive
```

Crossings use piecewise-linear interpolation on that grid:

```text
PMC = too cheap × not cheap        PME = too expensive × not expensive
IPP = cheap × expensive            OPP = too cheap × too expensive
acceptable range = [PMC, PME] when the points are defined and ordered
```

An absent or degenerate crossing is reported as undefined for the data, never
estimated. The PSM display may use model-generated illustrative responses only
when they are persistently marked and visibly labeled “simulated — not
evidence.” T-VW-01…04 validate exclusions, symmetric construction,
hand-computed interpolation, and undefined states.

### §4.8 Monte Carlo uncertainty

Monte Carlo samples only assumption bands, never within-segment ε. It uses an
injected seeded PRNG and returns P10/P50/P90, design win rate, and tornado
drivers by absolute MRR change. T-MC-01…05 establish determinism, distribution
handling, percentile rules, and the time budget.

### §4.9 Design linter

The linter makes deterministic, cited findings: dominated offers, fence
inversion, free-tier leakage via counterfactual, downgrade/cannibalization
mass, dead fences, choice overload, weak anchoring, and competitor loss. It
never applies invented behavioral uplift multipliers. T-LNT-01…09 pin all
predicates and dollar readouts.

### §4.10 Conjoint and MaxDiff-lite

Choice-based conjoint uses pooled MNL with effects-coded non-price attributes,
numeric account-month price where a WTP bridge is needed, analytic gradient and
Hessian, damped Newton steps, and named `ok`, `nonIdentifiable`, `separated`,
or `nonConverged` outcomes. A bridge requires `ok`, an invertible observed
information matrix, and a significantly negative price coefficient:
`ΔWTP = −(β_(a,l1) − β_(a,l0)) / β_p`. It is an aggregate proposal only.

MaxDiff-lite requires every item to appear, scores
`(best − worst) / appearances`, shifts then normalizes to 100, and returns a
uniform `100/m` when all raw scores are equal. T-CNJ-01…08 and T-MXD-01…03
cover the estimator, derivative gate, bridge, balance, and degenerate scoring.

### §4.11 Competitive price-value map and alternatives

The map is segment-scoped, with value on X, price on Y, and zero-utility ray
`P = εV`. It shows discrete Pareto non-dominated competitor points only; no
interpolation creates a market alternative. A competitor directly dominates a
tier iff `V_c ≥ V_t` and `P_c ≤ P_t`, strict in one. The same competitor data
becomes an envelope offer and contributes only to `CompetitorLoss`.
T-CMP-01…08 cover frontier construction, rays, direct dominance, engine shares,
conservation, empty competitor identity, and the B-001 tie policy.

### §4.13 Elasticity and cross-tier substitution matrix

Per segment, given an active envelope (§4.2) at within-segment `σ > 0`, the
demand share of the k-th active offer is
`share_k = Φ(ln(b_k)/σ) − Φ(ln(a_k)/σ)`. Let
`g(x) = φ(ln(x)/σ) / (σ · x)` be the standardized lognormal density with
`μ = 0`. The own-price share derivative is

```text
∂share_k / ∂P_k = − g(a_k) / (V_k − V_{k-1})
                 − g(b_k) / (V_{k+1} − V_k)
```

Cross-price share derivatives are non-zero only for the two envelope neighbors
of offer k, so the segment substitution matrix is tridiagonal in the
envelope-ordered active offers:

```text
∂share_{k-1} / ∂P_k = + g(a_k) / (V_k − V_{k-1})
∂share_{k+1} / ∂P_k = + g(b_k) / (V_{k+1} − V_k)
```

Boundary offers use `g(0) = 0` (outside-adjacent lower bound) and
`g(+∞) = 0` (top-envelope upper bound). Total-share conservation holds
exactly: `Σ_k ∂share_k / ∂P_j = 0` for every perturbed price `j`.

Own-price demand elasticity is `(P_k / share_k) · ∂share_k / ∂P_k`, always
`≤ 0` at price-positive, share-positive active offers. Revenue elasticity is
`1 + (own-price demand elasticity)`; it crosses zero at a local revenue peak
along a price sweep, matching §4.4.

These are _regime-local_ derivatives: they are valid only for price changes
small enough that the current active-offer envelope is preserved. A step large
enough to push an offer onto or off the envelope changes the derivative
structure. Use §4.4's price sweep for finite steps.

At `σ = 0` the segment collapses to a point mass; local derivatives are Dirac
distributions and are not reported. The elasticity readout is returned with
`degenerate: true`, empty per-offer elasticities, and empty substitution
entries. Use §4.4 for the finite-difference view a `σ = 0` segment supports.

Required tests: T-ELS-01 analytic-vs-finite-difference derivative gate on
three- and four-offer fixtures; T-ELS-02 column-sum conservation; T-ELS-03 the
`σ = 0` degenerate branch; T-ELS-04 own-price signs and the revenue-elasticity
zero-crossing near a price-sweep argmax.

### §4.12 Numerical conventions

Prices are non-negative; UI `σ_s` is `[0.05, 2.0]` with low/medium/high presets
of `0.25/0.5/0.9`. Percentages display to one decimal; USD uses
`Intl.NumberFormat`. Softmax uses log-sum-exp. All engine randomness is an
injected seeded PRNG. The engine remains pure TypeScript: no React, DOM,
`Date.now`, or ambient `Math.random`.
