# Wind Tunnel

**A wind tunnel for SaaS pricing & packaging decisions.** Model your buyers as explicit assumptions, design tiers and fences as a screening mechanism, and watch segments self-select — revealing revenue, conversion, and the surplus you're leaving on the table, before you ship a price.

> **Status: P7a in progress (latest committed version v0.8.2).** The static shell and local checks are ready; remote CI and deployment remain pending. Buyer-distribution math and economics have a tested pure-engine contract, scenarios persist locally and share safely, and the Model, Design, and live Simulate workbenches make buyer assumptions and packaging consequences inspectable.

## The idea

Most SaaS packaging is decided by gut and competitor-copying. But Good/Better/Best isn't decoration — it's a _screening mechanism_ (second-degree price discrimination): a menu designed so buyers with different willingness-to-pay sort themselves into the right tier. Once you write your assumptions down — who the segments are, what they'd pay, which features they value — the menu's consequences stop being opinions. They can be computed.

Wind Tunnel runs entirely on **your assumptions, made explicit**. It is not a billing tool and not an optimizer that needs live revenue data. It's useful before your first customer exists: a think-before-you-ship reasoning layer for the highest-leverage decision most SaaS teams make on vibes.

## Product target (v1.0 core + v1.1 extensions)

- **Model** — now available: buyer segments with P50-centred size and WTP bands, within-segment buyer spread, a keyboard-navigable segment × feature value matrix, provenance tags, and immediate engine-backed KPIs. The three template scenarios provide a practical first run.
- **Design** — now available: editable tiers, feature fences, free tier, add-ons, flat or per-seat pricing, and multiple design alternatives. The built-in linter flags dominated tiers, fence inversions, free-tier leakage (in dollars), cannibalization, competitor loss, and directional behavioral considerations without inventing numeric effects.
- **Simulate** — now available: closed-form self-selection turns the active model and menu into live MRR, conversion, ARPA, capture rate, buyer sorting, a reconciled value waterfall, and a 400-point residual price sweep for each tier. The mechanism diagram, A/B comparison, and user-facing competitor-loss share follow in v1.1.
- **Analyze — Uncertainty** — Monte Carlo over your assumption uncertainty with a tornado chart that tells you _which assumption to validate first_.
- **Analyze — Research** — v1.0 includes uncertainty and Van Westendorp; the v1.1 extensions add Choice-Based Conjoint, MaxDiff-lite, and bundling economics.
- **Analyze — Positioning** — v1.0 builds and tests competitor alternatives as a core engine/linter path; user-facing competitor entry, loss-share readouts, and the segment-scoped map arrive together in v1.1.
- **Communicate** — v1.0 ships the exportable Pricing Decision Record; the pricing-page mock follows in v1.1.

The economics is the point: the planned engine concentrates correctness in one primitive (utility upper-envelope selection over an offer menu). Its release gate requires every formula to be tested against closed-form results and a value-conservation identity to hold on every simulation. See [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) §4 for the normative math contract.

## What it is not

No accounts, no server, no telemetry, no data connectors. Fully client-side: your assumptions stay in your browser; compact model/design configurations can share as URLs, while full survey data travels only in an explicit JSON export.

## Planned stack

Next.js (App Router, static export) · React · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS · Zustand · Zod — fully client-side, with no server. Vercel is the selected deployment target; it is not connected or deployed yet, and the future static bundle remains portable to any static host. The plan requires light + dark themes, WCAG 2.1 AA intent with a recorded audit before any stronger claim, hand-rolled SVG visualization, Vitest + fast-check property tests against the economics contract, and Playwright end-to-end checks.

## Project docs

- [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) — working/handoff doc: full build plan, economic spec, decisions ledger, verification protocol.
- `docs/MODEL-SPEC.md` — the math contract (extracted in Phase 1; every engine test cites it).
- `docs/STATIC-HOST-HEADERS.md` — CSP and equivalent static-host security headers.

## Run locally

Use the Node version pinned in `.nvmrc`, then install the exact dependency graph and start the static shell:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Before a change is ready for review, run:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run test
npm run build
npm run e2e
```

`npm run build` produces the portable static bundle in `out/` and applies the 300 KiB gzip client-JavaScript gate. The browser check serves that export locally and verifies the light/dark shell, zero serious or critical axe violations, and the same-origin request allowlist.
